  <p class="intro">We’re a group of teens making a difference. We’re open to any high school student in Fayette County (public and private schools) who wants to be a peer leader and have an impact on the community.</p>
  <h1 class="pageTitle">What do we do?</h1>
  <p class="intro">We educate youth and adults on the risks involved in underage drinking through presentations to both adults and teens, television appearances, radio spots, and special projects.</p>
  <h1 class="pageTitle">When do we meet?</h1>
  <p class="intro">We meet approximately once a month for pizza and discussion. We currently meet on Sunday afternoons. Times are decided by the group, as we want to work around everyone’s busy schedule.</p>
  <h1 class="pageTitle">Why get involved?</h1>
  <p class="intro">Show your peers that there are betterthings to do than drink alcohol. Also, this coalition is a unique leadership opportunity to interact with community leaders concerning something that truly makes a difference in people’s lives.</p>
  <h2>How are we connected to the community? </h2>
  <p>This youth-led organization works with local and state leaders. We’re sponsored by the Fayette County ASAP.

The Youth Coalition serves as the Youth Voice for this county-wide group. Teens have the opportunity to interact with community leaders &amp; advise them on how to design programs to reduce teen substance abuse.</p>
